# ainu-mcp

A hosted [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server for the
Ainu-language toolchain (`aynumosir/ainu-mcp`). It lets an LLM (Claude Code,
Claude Desktop, etc.):

- **Edit the [Itak-uoeroskip glossary](https://itak.aynu.org)** directly in its
  Google Sheets source of truth — search, add, and update entries from chat.
- **Reference all the other Ainu materials** in one place — search ~195 k
  aligned corpus sentences, look up words across 11 dictionaries, scan the
  grammar bibliography and public project-authored Hokkaido/Sakhalin grammar chapters, and convert between Latin/Katakana/Cyrillic scripts.
- **Research an entry in one call** — `entry_research(word)` composes all of
  the above into a single structured response, so the model can draft a
  well-grounded glossary entry without round-tripping.

## How this repo is laid out

There is **one** MCP server — the hosted Cloudflare Worker — and a Python ETL
that feeds it. (An earlier local stdio server was retired; the Worker is now the
single MCP surface.)

| Part | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| [`worker/`](worker/) | The MCP server: a Cloudflare Worker (Streamable-HTTP MCP) at **`mcp.aynu.org`**, GitHub-OAuth gated, reading a **Turso** (libSQL, FTS5 trigram) reference store. See [`worker/README.md`](worker/README.md) for the deploy guide. |
| `src/ainu_mcp/` + [`etl/build_d1.py`](etl/build_d1.py) | The Python ETL: corpus / dictionary / grammar / glossary **loaders** that bake the reference data into the Worker's Turso DB. Not a server. |

**Access model:** any GitHub user who authenticates gets the read/reference
tools; members of the **`aynumosir`** org (or anyone in `ALLOWED_USERS`)
additionally get the glossary **write + maintenance** tools. Non-members never
see the write tools at all.

## Connecting

The server speaks Streamable-HTTP MCP and authenticates over GitHub OAuth (your
client opens a browser the first time).

Project-scoped (`.mcp.json` in any project where you want it available — this is
what this repo ships):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ainu": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://mcp.aynu.org/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

Or user-scoped — add the same block to `~/.claude.json` under `mcpServers`.

## Building / refreshing the reference data

The corpus, dictionaries, and grammar tables in Turso are built by the Python
ETL, which the Worker only reads. To rebuild the seed:

Requires **Python ≥ 3.13** and [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv).

```bash
uv sync
AINU_ROOT=/home/mkpoli/projects/Ainu uv run python etl/build_d1.py
```

`AINU_ROOT` (default `/home/mkpoli/projects/Ainu`) must contain:

- `ainu-corpora/data.jsonl`
- `ainu-dictionaries/<dict-name>/*.tsv`
- `ainu-grammar/{books,articles}/...`
- `ainu-grammar-hokkaido/src/lib/grammar/chapters/*.svelte` and `aynu-itah/src/lib/grammar/chapters/*.svelte` when present locally; otherwise the ETL uses the committed `src/ainu_mcp/data/authored_grammar_texts.json` snapshot for public authored Hokkaido/Sakhalin grammar plain text.

(The stopword list from [`aynumosir/ainu-stopwords`](https://github.com/aynumosir/ainu-stopwords)
is public, so the ETL fetches it from GitHub automatically — no checkout needed.
A local `ainu-stopwords/ainu-stopwords.txt` under `AINU_ROOT`, if present, is
used instead. The morphology tools do not feed into this seed — they proxy the
MDB forms engine live, see the Morphology section below.)

The seed is loaded into Turso with the batched libSQL loader (see
[`docs/REFRESHING-DATA.md`](docs/REFRESHING-DATA.md)). A scheduled GitHub Action
([`refresh-reference-data.yml`](.github/workflows/refresh-reference-data.yml))
rebuilds and reseeds Turso monthly. The live glossary is read straight from Google
Sheets, so glossary edits do not depend on this refresh.

## Tool surface

### Glossary (read + write — the editing loop)

| Tool | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `glossary_list_categories` | List sheet tabs with description and entry count |
| `glossary_list_entries(category, limit, offset)` | Page through entries in a category |
| `glossary_get_entry(category, row)` | Read one entry (returns `row_hash` for safe editing) |
| `glossary_search(query, fields?, category?, limit?)` | Substring search; optionally scoped to columns / one category |
| `glossary_add_entry(category, fields)` | Append a new row |
| `glossary_update_entry(category, row, fields, expected_row_hash?)` | Update cells, with optimistic locking |
| `glossary_untranslated(category?, langs?, limit?)` | Find rows missing 日本語/English/中文 — translation worklist |
| `glossary_audit()` | Find inconsistencies: `=an + N1`, parens, transitivity mismatch, duplicates, …  |
| `glossary_missing_high_frequency(top_n?, min_count?)` | Frequent corpus tokens that are dictionary-attested but not in glossary — vocab-gap worklist |
| `glossary_refresh_site_cache(dry_run?)` | Republish `table.json`/`sheets.json` to Cloudflare R2 so itak.aynu.org reflects edits immediately (instead of waiting for the weekly cron) |

Write + maintenance tools (`glossary_add_entry`, `glossary_update_entry`,
`glossary_audit`, `glossary_missing_high_frequency`,
`glossary_refresh_site_cache`) are only available to `aynumosir` org members.

Optimistic locking: pass the `row_hash` you got from `glossary_get_entry` or
`glossary_search` as `expected_row_hash` when updating. If someone else edited
the row since, the update is refused — re-read and retry.

### Reference (corpus, dictionaries, grammar)

| Tool | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `corpus_search(query, lang, dialect?, author?, limit?)` | Search aligned Ainu/Japanese sentences (`lang`: `ain`, `jpn`, `any`) |
| `corpus_stats` | Total sentences + top dialect distribution |
| `corpus_word_frequency(word)` | Corpus frequency of a word — count, rank, stopword flag, corpus totals (affix-clitics normalized, so `ku=nukar` = `nukar`) |
| `corpus_frequency_list(limit?, offset?, include_stopwords?, min_count?)` | Ranked frequency list; set `include_stopwords=false` to list content words only |
| `corpus_stopwords` | The Ainu stopword list (from [`aynumosir/ainu-stopwords`](https://github.com/aynumosir/ainu-stopwords)) |
| `dictionary_list` | List dictionaries with entry counts |
| `dictionary_lookup(word, dicts?, fields?, limit?)` | Multi-dictionary lookup (any field; supports substring) |
| `dictionary_reverse_lookup(aynu, dicts?, limit?)` | Ainu → Japanese/English by exact lemma first then substring; Ota's reverse index included |
| `grammar_list(kind?)` | List grammar books / articles, plus public authored Hokkaido/Sakhalin grammar chapters |
| `grammar_search(query, include_transcribed?, limit?)` | Filename/title/author/metadata search + fulltext over transcribed sources and authored grammar chapters |
| `grammar_get_text(path)` | Fetch complete plain text for public authored Hokkaido/Sakhalin grammar chapter paths |

### Morphology (possessed / plural / derived forms)

All three morphology tools are thin **proxies to the Ainu Morpheme Database
forms engine** ([`mdb.aynu.org/api/forms`](https://mdb.aynu.org/api/forms), over the
`env.MDB` service binding). The generative engine — possessed-noun forms,
plural verb forms, and derivations — and its data live in MDB; this server holds
no morphology copy of its own. The engine is **hybrid + provenanced**: rules
generate, harvest + curated exceptions validate/override, and every form is
tagged `source` (`rule` | `attested` | `exception`) + `confidence`. A
`source='rule'` form with no `attested_ref` is **predicted-but-unattested** —
surfaced as a discovery aid but flagged.

| Tool | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `morphology_search(query, category?, limit?)` | Search forms — `query` matches the surface form, its analysis/decomposition, or the lemma (substring, via `/api/forms?q=`); filter by `category` (`possessed`/`plural`/`derived`, mapped to the upstream `relation` facet) |
| `morphology_reverse_lookup(base, category?, limit?)` | From a base lemma to the forms built on it (e.g. `sapa` → `sapaha`); `base` is an exact `lemma_id` match (via `/api/forms?lemma=`) |
| `morphology_forms(lemma, category?, relation?, feature?, provenance?, limit?)` | Look up a lemma's possessed-noun forms (`sapa` → `sapaha`), plural verb forms (`-pa`/suppletive, role-sensitive object vs subject number) and derivations. Filter by `category` (domain: `nominal`/`verbal`), `relation` (`possessed`/`plural`/`derived`), `feature` (a feature-bundle facet), `provenance` |

Filter by `category` (domain: `nominal`/`verbal`), `relation` (`possessed`/`plural`/`derived`), `feature` (a feature-bundle facet), `provenance` |

### Localization (i18n strings)

| Tool | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `localizations_search(query, project?, lang?, limit?)` | Search how real Ainu-language software has translated its UI — `query` matches the Ainu text, the source-language original, or the message key; filter by `project` slug or `lang` (`ain`, `ain-Latn`, …) |
| `localizations_list_projects` | List the indexed projects (repo, format, source language, string count) |

### Aynuwiki (Ainu encyclopedias)

Live access to the two Ainu-language wikis — [Aynuwiki](https://wiki.aynu.org)
and the [Ainu Wikipedia in the Wikimedia Incubator](https://incubator.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wp/ain/)
(`Wp/ain/`) — over their MediaWiki APIs (no snapshot; always current).

| Tool | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `wiki_search(query, site?, limit?)` | Search articles; `site`: `aynuwiki`, `incubator`, or `both` (default) |
| `wiki_get_page(title, site?)` | Full article text (clean plain-text extract, or raw wikitext for template-heavy pages) |

### Early records (rec.aynu.org)

The [Early Records Database of the Ainu Language](https://rec.aynu.org) — the
crowd transcriptions made on [みんなで翻刻](https://app.honkoku.org/projects/ainu)
of Ainu-language records written between the seventeenth and nineteenth
centuries, with the wordlists parsed into items and an editorial layer giving
each item a modern reading, a certainty and a citation. That app owns the data
and the queries; these tools call its read API (`rec.aynu.org/api`) over the
`env.RECORDS` service binding and render the transcription markup as text.

| Tool | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `records_search(query?, source?, unit?, section?, certainty?, interpreted?, limit?, offset?)` | Search wordlist items — `query` matches the transcribed kana form, its alternatives, the modern reading (latin or kana), the Japanese gloss and the remark, ranked exact before prefix before substring; `unit` needs its `source`, since units of different works share slugs; `interpreted=false` finds items still without a modern reading |
| `records_list_sources` | The records, their units (witness or volume), holding institutions, page/item counts, section headings and TEI downloads |
| `records_get_page(source, unit, page, include_items?)` | One page: the diplomatic transcription line by line, the facsimile image, and the page's parsed items |

### Script conversion

| Tool | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `convert_script(text, from, to)` | Convert between `latn` / `kana` / `cyrl` |
| `detect_script(text)` | Detect script of a string |
| `script_all(text)` | Return all three script renditions in one call |

### Composed

| Tool | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `entry_research(word, ...)` | One-shot: scripts + syllables + glossary hits + dictionary hits + corpus examples |

## Example session

Typical edit flow Claude would run:

1. `entry_research("kunne")` → see existing dictionary defs, corpus contexts, current glossary entries
2. `glossary_search("kunne")` → confirm the row(s) and grab `row_hash`
3. `glossary_update_entry("色", 47, {"English": "black"}, expected_row_hash="…")`
